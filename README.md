Amazon CloudPlayer Downloader
=============================

This is a small bash script to download MP3s you bought from Amazon CloudPlayer using the ``.amz`` file you got during after your checkout.

I also put jwz's id3-clean.pl into this repo since it is useful for cleansing the files from Amazon customer/download IDs etc.
